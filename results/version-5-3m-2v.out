Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2021-04-15 17:54:19.
Progress(23) at 2021-04-15 17:54:22: 93 880 states generated (93 880 s/min), 47 622 distinct states found (47 622 ds/min), 8 819 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.0E-8
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 7.3E-9
Progress(53) at 2021-04-15 17:54:44: 1 212 950 states generated (2 738 757 s/min), 618 152 distinct states found (1 395 744 ds/min), 0 states left on queue.
1212950 states generated, 618152 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 53.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 8 and the 95th percentile is 5).

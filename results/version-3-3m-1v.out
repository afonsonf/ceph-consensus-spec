Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2021-03-17 14:59:25.
Progress(17) at 2021-03-17 14:59:28: 191 443 states generated (191 443 s/min), 91 650 distinct states found (91 650 ds/min), 28 776 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 1.3E-6
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = -1.1E-19
Progress(53) at 2021-03-17 15:00:36: 9 965 691 states generated (8 228 287 s/min), 4 724 533 distinct states found (3 900 865 ds/min), 0 states left on queue.
9965691 states generated, 4724533 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 53.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 7 and the 95th percentile is 5).

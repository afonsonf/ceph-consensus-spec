Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2021-09-05 13:08:52.
Progress(18) at 2021-09-05 13:08:55: 49.853 states generated (49.853 s/min), 23.727 distinct states found (23.727 ds/min), 6.552 states left on queue.
Progress(42) at 2021-09-05 13:09:55: 3.162.048 states generated (3.112.195 s/min), 1.692.997 distinct states found (1.669.270 ds/min), 229.178 states left on queue.
Progress(48) at 2021-09-05 13:10:55: 6.483.453 states generated (3.321.405 s/min), 3.270.729 distinct states found (1.577.732 ds/min), 263.987 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 1.3E-6
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 3.0E-7
9681395 states generated, 4842173 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 70.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 9 and the 95th percentile is 5).

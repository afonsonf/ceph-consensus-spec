Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2021-09-05 13:06:58.
Progress(32) at 2021-09-05 13:07:01: 143.290 states generated (143.290 s/min), 77.679 distinct states found (77.679 ds/min), 11.424 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.8E-9
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 1.1E-7
455894 states generated, 246713 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 53.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 7 and the 95th percentile is 4).

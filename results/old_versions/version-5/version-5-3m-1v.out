Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2021-04-15 17:56:07.
Progress(26) at 2021-04-15 17:56:10: 140 777 states generated (140 777 s/min), 73 370 distinct states found (73 370 ds/min), 11 840 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 7.7E-9
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 3.8E-9
Progress(53) at 2021-04-15 17:56:22: 756 324 states generated (2 687 241 s/min), 390 719 distinct states found (1 388 235 ds/min), 0 states left on queue.
756324 states generated, 390719 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 53.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 7 and the 95th percentile is 5).

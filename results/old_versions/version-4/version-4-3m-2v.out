Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2021-04-04 19:54:56.
Progress(15) at 2021-04-04 19:54:59: 97 851 states generated (97 851 s/min), 44 161 distinct states found (44 161 ds/min), 14 051 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 1.2E-6
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 4.0E-5
Progress(53) at 2021-04-04 19:56:01: 9 510 440 states generated (8 512 238 s/min), 4 333 078 distinct states found (3 878 284 ds/min), 0 states left on queue.
9510440 states generated, 4333078 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 53.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 8 and the 95th percentile is 5).

Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2021-04-04 19:59:02.
Progress(18) at 2021-04-04 19:59:05: 153 184 states generated (153 184 s/min), 68 489 distinct states found (68 489 ds/min), 17 085 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 1.3E-7
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 2.0E-7
Progress(53) at 2021-04-04 19:59:32: 3 161 727 states generated (6 017 561 s/min), 1 452 593 distinct states found (2 764 649 ds/min), 0 states left on queue.

## Trace example of a segment of the algorithm

This folder has na example trace of a run of the algorithm. The trace goes until one monitor has 2 transactions committed (e.g. last_committed[mon] = 2).

The trace is pretty printed in the file: [trace.txt](trace.txt). <br>
The pretty printed version is obtained using the tlc trace tool with the MC.out file.

The trace can also be viewed in the toolbox loading the file MC.out (figure below).
